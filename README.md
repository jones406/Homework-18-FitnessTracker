# Workout Tracker

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

THe front-end code was provided and I built the back-end of the app with a Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and Express.

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
